    <p>
        My name is Malachi Roth-Cohen,
        and I am a creative.
        I have done modeling, (editorial, conceptual, commercial, e-commerce) for 5 years.

        <br><br>
        I am a self-taught artist and have been painting my whole life. During all of this, I have had a camera with me capturing the moments that feel essential.
        This page is dedicated to displaying my different creative outlets and to create new connections through my work.
