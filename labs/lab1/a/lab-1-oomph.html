<h3> Malachi's calender + list</h3>

<p> <h5> About: </h5> My name is Malachi and I really like art. I paint all the time, whenever I get the chance. Before college, I had a corner in my room devoted to oil paints, brushes, easel, and other related art tools. It was so delightful, anyhow, now I have to travel more to paint because oil paints also have an obnoxious smell. And thatâ€™s okay because sometimes beautiful things happen on these walks. For example, one night walking back from the studio I saw the snow falling down and it was so nice against the sky. Although my fingertips were cold, seeing water turn to snow was worth it. I also learned how to make a website when I was really young, but forgot most of the knowledge. I am hoping it comes back like a hidden muscle, banished away in my body.
