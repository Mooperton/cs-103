                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>
                    Jungle music is a subgenre of electronic dance music (EDM) that began
                igniting dancefloors across London, England, in the early 1990s with
                its gritty mix of deep basslines and rhythms influenced by reggae and hip-hop.
                This fueled the sound system and rave scene in the early ‘90s, gave rise to jungle music,
                which quickly encompassed the sound of young Britain in the mid-1990s.

                <h3>Prominent artists</h3>
                <p>
                    most notably 1994’s “Incredible” by DJ/producer M-Beat,
                    Renegade’s “Terrorist,” and “Original Nuttah” by Shy FX with vocals by UK Apache.
                    My Dad, Damian Cohen, who made many mixes featuring prominent reggae samples and breakbeats throughout. Which characterized my childhood soundtrack.

                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Beats: Jungle music moves at a breezy 160 beats per minute (BPM)—faster than early
                        hardcore breakbeat productions—with approximately the same tempo as drum and bass.
                        It’s also significantly faster than many of the reggae and dub tracks it samples,
                        which clock in at ninety to 120 BPM, and more recent forms of EDM like dubstep, which operates at 140 BPM.</li>
                    <li>Production: The jungle sound features heavy basslines under a propulsive sonic landscape of energetic breakbeats and synth lines. Synths connect jungle music to breakbeat hardcore and house music;
                        the synths are ominous in early jungle and darkcore and more melodic in later versions.</li>
                    <li>Samples: Jungle producers echoed hip-hop’s vocal and instrumental samples to lend flavor to a track. The “Amen break,” drawn from the Winstons’ 1969 single “Amen, Brother,” is the most frequently used soul/funk instrumental sample, as was the dub siren, an audio test tone that became
                    a siren in the hands of legendary dub producers like King Tubby.
                        Jungle music also used vocal samples from reggae and dancehall,
                    as well as classic R&B and funk hits like Lyn Collins’ “Think (About It).”</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Reggae samples and reggae-influenced tracks had been a feature of many breakbeat hardcore tracks since 1990,
                    particularly from producers such as Shut Up and Dance,[9] however Ibiza Records,[10] and the Rebel MC were arguably the first to bring the sound system influence solidly into releases.
                    The track "We Are I.E." by Lennie De-Ice is often credited as being the track that laid down the foundations for jungle with its ragga bass-line.
